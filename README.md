#### Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 2
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information:

For context, we are pre-revenue, pre-public product and do not have any of those "hard" metrics to show. We do have some GTM metrics which are useful but, per our mentor Boris Jabes, he suggested we focus on "beta/pilot users/customers" that might be more in-line with our overall strategy as we build for the enterprise.

Right now, we're focusing on connecting with organizations that will actively pilot our prototype and added 2 significant relationships to the mix. We'll continue to iron out this metric as well as add context to it as we move forward.

#### Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 1
3. Growth %: 50%
4. Additional Information

Again, we are pre-revenue and without a public product. What we did manage to do is secure another serious interest for an enterprise launch partner (or design partner) with a very serious and well-known company. They have 300+ engineers and are scaling fast with needs for mass-agile transformation and insight into their engineering impact and spend. Although we do not necessarily have the staff necessary to add another customer today, we hope to complete our raise soon and hire / onboard some new employees to help with the heavy-lifting.
