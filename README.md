1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 2
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information:

For context, we are pre-revenue, pre-public product and do not have any of those "hard" metrics to show. We do have some GTM metrics which are useful but, per our mentor Boris Jabes, he suggested we focus on "beta/pilot users/customers" that might be more in-line with our overall strategy as we build for the enterprise.

Right now, we're focusing on connecting with organizations that will actively pilot our prototype and added 2 significant relationships to the mix. We'll continue to iron out this metric as well as add context to it as we move forward.

4. Additional Information

Again, we are pre-revenue and without a public product. What we did manage to do is secure another serious interest for an enterprise launch partner (or design partner) with a very serious and well-known company. They have 300+ engineers and are scaling fast with needs for mass-agile transformation and insight into their engineering impact and spend. Although we do not necessarily have the staff necessary to add another customer today, we hope to complete our raise soon and hire / onboard some new employees to help with the heavy-lifting.

#### Update

1. Metric: Weeks til Launch
2. Value: 4
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information

We are not a public SaaS product yet and have a ways to go from there. Our current GTM is to encounter larger enterprise customers and provide our unique technology and services in a high-touch engagement. Many of these earlier customers are also "Design Partners" who are helping us to build a best-in-class product that can be scaled.

We know that the conversations take time to mature and we're already securing these early customers / Design Partners. We believe we have a few more weeks until we can deploy something into our first-round customers.

4. Additional Information

We're in active conversations with a handful of other large-scale enterprise organizations and are excited about the continued validation of real pain points and moving the conversations forward. We're in the middle of financing conversations as well, which are a "necessary evil" for us as we know that we'll need some capital to scale but do not enjoy time away from product building! Things are 👍🏼  right now!
