**Weekly Report**

The Pinpoint team was accepted into Spring/Summer 2017 [YCombinator Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org) and every week we are to report our metric updates on growth.

### Week 1 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 2
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information:

For context, we are pre-revenue, pre-public product and do not have any of those "hard" metrics to show. We do have some GTM metrics which are useful but, per our mentor Boris Jabes, he suggested we focus on "beta/pilot users/customers" that might be more in-line with our overall strategy as we build for the enterprise.

Right now, we're focusing on connecting with organizations that will actively pilot our prototype and added 2 significant relationships to the mix. We'll continue to iron out this metric as well as add context to it as we move forward.

### Week 2 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 1
3. Growth %: 50%
4. Additional Information

Again, we are pre-revenue and without a public product. What we did manage to do is secure another serious interest for an enterprise launch partner (or design partner) with a very serious and well-known company. They have 300+ engineers and are scaling fast with needs for mass-agile transformation and insight into their engineering impact and spend. Although we do not necessarily have the staff necessary to add another customer today, we hope to complete our raise soon and hire / onboard some new employees to help with the heavy-lifting. 

### Week 3 Update

1. Metric: Weeks til Launch
2. Value: 4
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information

We are not a public SaaS product yet and have a ways to go from there. Our current GTM is to encounter larger enterprise customers and provide our unique technology and services in a high-touch engagement. Many of these earlier customers are also "Design Partners" who are helping us to build a best-in-class product that can be scaled.

We know that the conversations take time to mature and we're already securing these early customers / Design Partners. We believe we have a few more weeks until we can deploy something into our first-round customers.

### Week 4 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 1
3. Growth %: 50%
4. Additional Information

We're in active conversations with a handful of other large-scale enterprise organizations and are excited about the continued validation of real pain points and moving the conversations forward. We're in the middle of financing conversations as well, which are a "necessary evil" for us as we know that we'll need some capital to scale but do not enjoy time away from product building! Things are 👍🏼  right now!

### Week 5 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 0
3. Growth %: 0%
4. Additional Information

We didn't actually add any new customers into our already existing backlog and instead are focused on serving our first-line, early-stage customers and making them really, really happy.

We are also in the process of putting a venture financing round together, so, that has honestly been a necessary distraction to company-building, although we are nearing the end of that process - thank goodness.

### Week 6 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 1
3. Growth %: 100%
4. Additional Information

We added a new customer to the list and we've got a very large and growing backlog of customers that we'd love to engage with fully but do not have enough staff (quite yet) to handle. These are great problems to have, to be honest.

What we are doing is changing our team's focus and strategy on building out the product with our first few handful of customers... we are calling them "design partners" as they will assist in not only implementing and using the product but also helping us make it better for agnostic use.

We are also doing some venture work as well and that's taken up a substantial amount of time, but, should be over shortly.

All very good problems to have! Grateful for the community and the support that we've got!

### Week 7 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 0
3. Growth %: 0%
4. Additional Information

Continue to grind this week and close our financing round. Not much action, tbh, but, important work to be done. We're also onboarding new staff, so, that's our main focus right now for the week!

### Week 8 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 0
3. Growth %: 0%
4. Additional Information

Not much of an update, tbh... started the process to onboard our first customer and finalizing operational needs for our first 2 employees that we've hired... and 2 interns! Very positive momentum. Feeling great.

### Week 9 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 0
3. Growth %: 0
4. Additional Information

Quite literally the same update as Week #8.

### Week 10 Update

1. Metric: Other
2. Value: 
3. Growth %: N/A
4. Additional Information


### Week 11 Update

1. Metric: Other
